abstract: "DNA polymerase stalling activates the ATR checkpoint kinase, which in
  turn suppresses fork collapse and breakage. Herein, we describe use of ATR
  inhibition (ATRi) as a means to identify genomic sites of problematic DNA
  replication in murine and human cells. Over 500 high-resolution ATR-dependent
  sites were ascertained using two distinct methods: replication protein A
  (RPA)-chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and breaks identified by TdT
  labeling (BrITL). The genomic feature most strongly associated with ATR
  dependence was repetitive DNA that exhibited high structure-forming potential.
  Repeats most reliant on ATR for stability included structure-forming
  microsatellites, inverted retroelement repeats, and quasi-palindromic AT-rich
  repeats. Notably, these distinct categories of repeats differed in the
  structures they formed and their ability to stimulate RPA accumulation and
  breakage, implying that the causes and character of replication fork collapse
  under ATR inhibition can vary in a DNA-structure-specific manner.
  Collectively, these studies identify key sources of endogenous replication
  stress that rely on ATR for stability."

summary: >-
  - >500 ATR-dependent sites were identified in the mouse and human genomes

  - ATR-inhibitor-driven fork collapse occurs primarily at structure-forming repeats

  - Repeat structures include non-B form DNA and hairpins (AT-rich and inverted repeats)

  - Discrete repeat types accumulate RPA differentially upon fork collapse
