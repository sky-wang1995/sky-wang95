abstract: "ABC-DLBCLs have unfavorable outcomes and chronic activation of CBM
  signal amplification complexes that form due to polymerization of BCL10
  subunits, which is affected by recurrent somatic mutations in ABC-DLBCLs.
  Herein, we show that BCL10 mutants fall into at least two functionally
  distinct classes: missense mutations of the BCL10 CARD domain and truncation
  of its C-terminal tail. Truncating mutation abrogated a novel motif through
  which MALT1 inhibits BCL10 polymerization, trapping MALT1 in its activated
  filament-bound state. CARD missense mutation enhanced BCL10 filament
  formation; forming glutamine network structures that stabilize BCL10
  filaments. Mutant forms of BCL10 were less dependent on upstream CARD11
  activation and thus manifested resistance to BTK inhibitors, whereas BCL10
  truncating but not CARD mutants were hypersensitive to MALT1 inhibitors.
  Therefore, BCL10 mutations are potential biomarkers for BTK inhibitor
  resistance in ABC-DLBCL and further precision can be achieved by selecting
  therapy based on specific biochemical effects of distinct mutation classes."
