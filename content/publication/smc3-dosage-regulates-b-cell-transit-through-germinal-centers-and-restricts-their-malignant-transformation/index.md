abstract: During the germinal center (GC) reaction, B cells undergo extensive
  redistribution of cohesin complex and three-dimensional reorganization of
  their genomes. Yet, the significance of cohesin and architectural programming
  in the humoral immune response is unknown. Herein we report that homozygous
  deletion of Smc3, encoding the cohesin ATPase subunit, abrogated GC formation,
  while, in marked contrast, Smc3 haploinsufficiency resulted in GC hyperplasia,
  skewing of GC polarity and impaired plasma cell (PC) differentiation.
  Genome-wide chromosomal conformation and transcriptional profiling revealed
  defects in GC B cell terminal differentiation programs controlled by the
  lymphoma epigenetic tumor suppressors Tet2 and Kmt2d and failure of
  Smc3-haploinsufficient GC B cells to switch from B cell- to PC-defining
  transcription factors. Smc3 haploinsufficiency preferentially impaired the
  connectivity of enhancer elements controlling various lymphoma tumor
  suppressor genes, and, accordingly, Smc3 haploinsufficiency accelerated
  lymphomagenesis in mice with constitutive Bcl6 expression. Collectively, our
  data indicate a dose-dependent function for cohesin in humoral immunity to
  facilitate the B cell to PC phenotypic switch while restricting malignant
  transformation.
